See it in action:

To do:  
* Add "view more" buttton, that loads news from the next page
* Understand how to hide API keys
* Narrow down the news sources, some blogs look irrelevant
* Add max size of content area. When wide screens it stretches badly
* How to fix the footer down the screen
* Cosmetics in the background and color selection
* Add sentiment analysis
* Find light weight image to replace when null
